            By processing over 5,000 data points per student session, our neural networks can detect subtle patterns in learning behavior that human educators might miss. This allows for micro-adjustments to content difficulty, explanation style, and practice frequencyâ€”creating a truly adaptive learning environment that accelerates mastery.
